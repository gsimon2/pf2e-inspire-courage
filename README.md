A simple module for [FoundryVtt](https://foundryvtt.com/) that adds a button to character token HUDs that allows for the toggling of Inspire Courage. This utilizes the PF2e "Inspire Courage" spell effect. Only applies to to actual character actors, not NPCs due to how spell effect interact with their sheet.

When inspire courage is active, the inspire courage effect icon will appear on the token and the spell effect will be added to the actor's sheet. The bonus to attack and damage rolls will automatically apply.
